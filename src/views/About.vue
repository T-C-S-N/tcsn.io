const aboutText = ref(`I'm Toca, a software engineer based in Brussels specializing in front-end architecture and scalable design systems. With experience spanning fintech, government, logistics, and education sectors, I focus on building accessible, user-centric interfaces that solve real business problems.
My approach combines technical expertise in Vue, React, and modern web technologies with a strong foundation in design principles. I believe great software bridges the gap between business needs and user experienceâ€”architecting solutions that are both elegant and practical.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring photography, architectural design, or diving into graphic art. I bring this creative perspective to every project I build.`)
